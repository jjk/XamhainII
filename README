On a night in the lonesome October…

In 1997 I wrote the first version of this screensaver for the BeOS.
It was called “Samhain” because of the Celtic theme, and because it was
released shortly before Halloween.

In the twelve years since then, I ported it to X11 (renaming it “Xamhain”)
and later to OpenGL (involving a massive rewrite, and thus another renaming).
These versions were never released, mostly because of laziness.

Halloween is near again, and to celebrate the acquisition of my first Mac,
I’m porting it yet another time. Enjoy.
