//  Traditionally, Celtic knotwork is drawn on a diagonal grid
//  overlaid with straight lines and circles.  Xamhain uses
//  a simpler method devised by Andy Sloss, which divides the knot
//  into sections at every other grid point.  Each section can be
//  uniquely described by the directions in which the knot passes
//  through the section's corners, plus the directions the two lines
//  take in the interior of the section.
//  There are three possible directions (diagonal, horizontal and
//  vertical), so there are 3^5 = 243 basic sections.  The horizontal
//  and vertical sections can be split in half for closing up the edges
//  of a knot, yielding another 36 shapes.  These are represented
//  as a section with two corners that have "no" direction.
//
//  Because of symmetries, the 279 different sections can be drawn
//  using only 10 basic strokes - see class StrokeSet.
